# Kolibri Studio

[![codecov](http://codecov.io/github/learningequality/studio/coverage.svg?branch=develop)](http://codecov.io/github/learningequality/studio?branch=develop])

Check out our [beta site](https://studio.learningequality.org)!

Kolibri Studio is a web application designed to deliver educational materials to [Kolibri](http://learningequality.org/kolibri/). It supports:

- Organizing and publishing content channels in the format suitable for import from Kolibri
- Curating content and remixing of existing channels into custom channels aligned to various educational standards, country curricula, and special needs
- Creating learning pathways and assessments
- Uploading new content through the web interface or programatically using [ricecooker-powered](https://github.com/learningequality/ricecooker) content import scripts

Kolibri Studio uses [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) for the backend and is transitioning from [Backbone.js](https://backbonejs.org/) to [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) for the frontend.

If you are looking for help setting up custom content channels, uploading and organizing resources using Kolibri Studio, please refer to the [User Guide](https://kolibri-studio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).


## Getting started

### Get the code

- Install and set up [Git](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/) on your computer. Try [this tutorial](http://learngitbranching.js.org/) if you need more practice
- [Sign up and configure your GitHub account](https://github.com/join) if you don't have one already.
- Fork the [studio repo](https://github.com/learningequality/studio) to create a copy of the studio repository under your own github username. This will make it easier to [submit pull requests](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request). Read more details [about forking](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) from GitHub
- Clone your repo locally

Tip: [Register your SSH keys](https://help.github.com/en/articles/connecting-to-github-with-ssh) on GitHub to avoid having to repeatedly enter your password.


### Install and run services

Studio requires some background services to be running:

* Minio
* Postgres
* Redis

The instructions below show how to set up the services using Docker. This works for many people, but not everyone. If docker is giving you issues, you can also [manually install](docs/manual_setup.md) the services either on your host machine or in a virtual machine (for example, using Vagrant with Virtualbox or VMWare).

First, [install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/).

Next, run

```bash
make dcservicesup
```

This will take a while the first time it's run, and might need to be restarted a couple times if it errors out initially.

To confirm that the services are running, run `docker ps`, and you should see three containers, for example:

```bash
> docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                             COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                    NAMES
e09c5c203b93        redis:4.0.9                       "docker-entrypoint.s…"   51 seconds ago      Up 49 seconds       0.0.0.0:6379->6379/tcp   studio_vue-refactor_redis_1
6164371efb6b        minio/minio                       "minio server /data"     51 seconds ago      Up 49 seconds       0.0.0.0:9000->9000/tcp   studio_vue-refactor_minio_1
c86bbfa3a59e        postgres:9.6                      "docker-entrypoint.s…"   51 seconds ago      Up 49 seconds       0.0.0.0:5432->5432/tcp   studio_vue-refactor_postgres_1
```


To shut down the services, run

```bash
make dcservicesdown
```

### Python dependencies

To develop on Kolibri Studio, you'll need:

* Python 3.6

Managing Python installations can be quite tricky. We *highly* recommend using package managers like `Homebrew <http://brew.sh/>`__ on Mac or ``apt`` on Debian for this. Never modify your system's built-in version of Python

Then set up:

```bash
# Create virtual environment
virtualenv venv

# Activate virtual environment
. venv/bin/activate

# Install all dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

# Set up pre-commit hooks
pre-commit install
```

Exit the virtual environment by running `exit`.

#### Adding or updating dependencies

We use `pip-tools` to ensure all our dependencies use the same versions on all deployments.

To add a dependency, add it to either `requirements.in` or `requirements-dev.in`, then
run `pip-compile requirements[-dev].in` to generate the .txt file. Please make sure that
both the `.in` and `.txt` file changes are part of the commit when updating dependencies.

To update a dependency, use `pip-compile --upgrade-package [package-name] requirements[-dev].in`

For more details, please see the [pip-tools docs on Github](https://github.com/jazzband/pip-tools).

### Yarn and Javascript dependencies

As described above, Kolibri Studio has dependencies that rely on Node.js version 10.x. `nodeenv` is a useful tool for using specific versions of Node.js tools in Python environments. You'll also need [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install) installed.

All the javascript dependencies are listed in `package.json`. To install them run the following [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) command:

```bash
# Set up Node 10.x environment
nodeenv -p --node=10.15.3
# Install javascript dependencies
yarn install --network-timeout 1000000
```

The `network-timeout` helps avoid a timeout issue with the Material Icons dependency.


### Initial setup

To set up the database, run:

```bash
yarn run devsetup
```

### Running the development server

In one tab, start `celery` using:

```bash
make prodceleryworkers
```

In another tab, start Django and the webpack build using:


```bash
yarn run devserver:hot  # with Vue hot module reloading
# or
yarn run devserver  # without hot module reloading
```

This will take a few mins to build the frontend. When it's done, you can log in with `a@a.com` password `a` at h[ttp://localhost:8080/accounts/login/](http://localhost:8080/accounts/login/)


## Additional tools

### Running tests

You can run tests using the following command:

```bash
yarn run test
```

View [more testing tips](docs/running_tests.md)


### Profiling and local production testing

If you want to test the performance of your changes, you can start up a local server
with settings closer to a production environment like so:

```bash
yarn run localprodserver
```

Once the local production server is running, you can also use Locust to test your changes
under scenarios of high demand like so:

```bash
cd deploy/chaos/loadtest
make timed_run
make stop_slaves  # mac: killall python
```

### Linting

Front-end linting is run using:

```bash
yarn run lint-all
```

Some linting errors can be fixed automatically by running:

```bash
yarn run lint-all:fix
```

Make sure you've set up pre-commit hooks as described above. This will ensure that linting is automatically run on staged changes before every commit.
